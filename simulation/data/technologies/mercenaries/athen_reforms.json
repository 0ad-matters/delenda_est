	"description": "Historians have debated about just what kind of 'peltasts' were affected by the reforms of the Athenian general Iphicrates; one of the most popular positions is that he improved the performance of the Greek skirmishers so that they would be able to engage in prolonged hand-to-hand fighting as part of the main battle line, while another strong opinion posits that he worked his changes upon hoplites, such as lighter armor and longer weapons, that were an important factor in late 5th and early 4th century B.C. Greek land warfare. A third possibility is that his reforms were limited to hoplites serving as marines on board ships of the Athenian navy.",
