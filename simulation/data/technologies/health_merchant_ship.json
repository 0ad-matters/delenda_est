	"description": "Sea travel was a terrifying prospect for the peoples of the ancient world. From mythical monsters such as the Greek Scylla or the Norse Kraken, to more mundane yet equally terrible maelstroms and icebergs, deadly dangers lurked in every ocean. However, piracy remained the number one realistic danger to the safe use of shipping lanes. A good complement of marines aboard helped to dissuade the more cowardly pirates and would sometimes even effectively fight off those brigands whose greed overpowered their sense of self-preservation.",
