	"History": "The Republican Romans have strong infantry, but weak cavalry. They have access to a large array of siege weapons and all warships. Their special buildings include the Army Camp and Siege Walls, both of which can be built even in enemy territory. They advance to the Town Phase by building the famous Temple of Vesta, and then advance to the City Phase by building the Temple of Mars. Lastly, they achieve Empire Phase by building the gigantic Temple of Jupiter.",
