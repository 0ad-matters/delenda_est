    <Tooltip>Build in neutral or own territory to harvest vegetables for food. Build on farmland terrain to gain a +100% farming boost. Max gatherers: 5. There is a diminishing return effect where it is more efficient to use fewer gatherers per field.</Tooltip>
    <History>Farming originated around 9500 BC in India and the Middle East. The history of agriculture is a central element of human history, as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide socio-economic change. Wealth-building and militaristic specializations rarely seen in hunter-gatherer cultures are commonplace in agricultural and agro-industrial societies - when farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in the tribe/nation/empire were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition.</History>
