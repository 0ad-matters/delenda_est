    <History>Aurelian, or Lucius Domitius Aurelianus Augustus, was a Roman emperor who ruled from 270 to 275 AD. He was born into a humble family and managed to rise in the military ranks to become an emperor. During his reign, he managed to defeat the Alemanni. He also won in battles against the Goths, the Juthungi, the Vandals, the Carpi, and the Sarmatians. He conquered the Palmyrene Empire in 273 and thus restored the kingdom’s eastern provinces. He then conquered the Western Gallic Empire, thus reuniting the empire. \n\nHe built the Aurelian Walls in Rome and managed to end the crisis of the 3rd-century Roman Empire and, thus, won the title of \“Restitutor Orbis\” or \“Restorer of the World\”. He carried out an important religious reform, establishing the monotheistic cult of the Sun, the supreme deity of whom the emperor was an emanation. He had the Sun god, Sol Invictus, proclaimed as the main patron of the empire and dedicated a temple to him on the Field of Mars. He was killed by one of his former slaves in 275, who believed an incorrect rumor that he was about to be proscribed for corruption.</History>
