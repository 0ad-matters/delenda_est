    <History>Skiritae were some of the most reliable allied soldiers serving in the Spartan military.  They always had the honor of remaining on the left flank of a Spartan phalanx (Thucydides 5.67) and were deployed to face the any problem which could come to bear the army. (Xenophon 4.2.1-4)</History>
