    <History>The largest part of the Lacedaemonian population consisted of Helots. Helots formed the lowest level in Spartan society and were slaves owned by the Spartan state, usually working as peasants or servants. The Spartans were in constant fear of a helot revolt and heavily suppressed them. Every Fall, the Ephors (Spartan chancellors) would declare war on them, allowing all Spartans to murder any Helot they encountered without getting punished.</History>
