    <History>As the Punic Wars wore on, the veteran infantrymen of Carthage were able to re-equip themselves with the best spoils from their slain Roman foes. This looted equipment included the tall Roman scutum shield, chainmail body armor, and the gladius, which was a superior sidearm to the old xiphos sword.</History>
