    <History>Trade was vital for Athens' economy. The poor quality of the soil in Greece made it difficult for Athens to produce enough food for its population. To meet the high demand, the required grain was imported from Egypt and the Athenian colonies along the Black Sea. Fish from the nearby Aegean Sea was also a common way to supplement the Athenian diet.</History>
