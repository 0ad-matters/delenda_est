    <History>Evidence shows that Athenian houses frequently had a second story and sometimes a sort of tower, however this latter feature was more likely to be found in the countryside. Inside the house, the walls were usually whitewashed, while the floor was made of simple packed earth or paving stones. Windows were small and built very close to the ceiling, ostensibly to allow heat to escape, but this also discouraged outsiders from invading the home.\n\nA Greek household, or oikos, usually housed extended family with grandparents, parents, sons, their wives, children, unmarried daughters, and slaves if they were wealthy enough to own them. However, only the most trusted slaves would live in the main house and the rest would be quartered in a separate building, possibly with the animals.\n\nThe houses of the middle and upper class were built around a central courtyard that led off to the different rooms such as storerooms, the andrôn where the man hosted his symposium (parties), and the gynaikôn or women’s quarters. It is debated whether the gynaikôn was where the women lived in to or whether it was where they worked and spent their free time. However, there is some literary evidence to support the former.</History>
