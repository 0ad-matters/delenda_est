    <History>Athenians traded at the agora, a large marketplace, or emporion, in the heart of the city. They bought staple foods, jewelry, slaves, and other commodities. In return, they sold local products such as olive oil, wine, grapes, honey, and silver. Athenian pottery was especially popular and widely sought after by customers from all throughout the known world, as it was renowned for its high artistic and functional qualities. The manufacture of this pottery was unique to the Greek, especially Athenian, culture.</History>
